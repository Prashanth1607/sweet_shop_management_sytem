# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Sweet Shop Management System is a full-stack e-commerce web application designed as a TDD Kata to demonstrate modern development practices. The system enables users to browse, search, and purchase sweets while providing administrative capabilities for inventory management. The application emphasizes responsiveness, reliability, and efficiency through test-driven development, clean coding practices, and modern web technologies.

3. WHEN an admin performs inventory operations THEN the system SHALL validate admin permissions before execution
4. WHEN an admin restocks items THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to increase quantities
5. WHEN non-admin users attempt admin operations THEN the system SHALL deny access and return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 6: Data Persistence and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want reliable data storage, so that the application maintains data integrity and availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria
